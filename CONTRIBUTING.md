We want as many people as possible to able to reproduce and enjoy the mirror, 
and therefor we ask for your help to contribute with your ideas. 

But for us and you to have the best times together we need a little bit of standards.

First of all we need to be good at using pull request, so we dont mess up our master.
Second you can create as many branches as you want, but make sure you use them for something productive. 
Third when you first create a pull request make sure that someone else looks at it, we wouldnt want to be adding some thingy naughty in our system.

And last but the most important 
Enjoy your work, dont make any thing you would think back about as a waste of time.

And as they say in the kardemommelaw, 
  One shall not bother others,one shall be nice and kind, otherwise one may do as one pleases.
	Man skal ikke plage andre, man skal være grei og snill, og for øvrig kan man gjøre hva man vil.
